### Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach for Imbalanced Learning 

Original paper can be found [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4633969&url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4633969) 

This module extends the idea presented in the paper by Haibo He et al. to include oversampling for multiclass classification problems. It is designed to be compatible with [scikit-learn] (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

Props to [fmfn](https://github.com/fmfn) for his good code structure and documentation
